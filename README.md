My entry for a competition

To run this: download repository, unzip, run main.py, go full screen, and scroll up a bit. Occasionally python will start you in the middle of the screen, and you'll miss my awesome ASCII titles.
Preferably run on a Windows10 computer with a 1920x1080 or higher resoluotion monitor.
This is not because the graphics are fancy - just because their size is designed for a full sized monitor :-)

The file "Program Documentation" has a brief overview on how the code works, and the bibliography gives a brief list of the resourses I used. Most of it was wikipedia.

If this doesn't run on your computer, please tell me so I can fix it quick!
