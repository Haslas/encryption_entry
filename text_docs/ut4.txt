The above is called a Vigenere Square. It is used to encrypt data. Say the message “THEY ARE COMING” needed to be encrypted, the first thing to do would be choosing a key. 
Unlike the Caesar cypher, the key for Vigenere is a word. Let’s say we chose “Hedge”. We would pair each letter of the plaintext to a letter in the key. If the key is not long enough, we would repeat it.
Plain: T H E Y A R E C O M I N G
Key:   H E D G E H E D G E H E D  
We would then encrypt the plaintext by finding essentially using the letter of the plaintext as an X-Coordinate, and the letter of the key as a Y-Coordinate.
This pair of coordinates would point to a single letter, which would then be used as the cipher letter.  Using the square, we can find the ciphertext:
Plain:	T H E Y A R E C O M I N G
Key:	H E D G E H E D G E H E D  
Cipher:	A L H E E Y I F U Q P R J
To decrypt the message, we would go through it letter-by letter.  We know the ciphertext letter and the key letter, we want to find the plaintext letter.
We know that the key and plaintext letters will be on the sides of the square, and will intersect at the ciphertext letter. Considering this,
we would use the row of the current key letter, and find the which column of the ciphertext letter in this row. The column header must be the plaintext character.
The three characters will always be perpendicular to each other. If we have two, we will always be able to find the third. We would repeat this process for all characters in the cipher.
