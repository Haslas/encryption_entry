Great job! Scytales were commonly used by the Spartans, for communication during military campaigns. However, finding a strip of leather with writing scrawled all over it was often a give-away that it was an encrypted message.
To combat this, the message was often put through a process of steganography. This is the practice of hiding data rather than encrypting it. For instance, a strip of leather could be worn as a seemingly innocent belt.
The practice of steganography was common in classical times. Herodotus (a famous ancient historian) tells stories of messages being tattooed on a human scalp, before leaving the scalp to re-grow its hair.
This would conceal the message, which could then be revealed by shaving the slave in question.
Stenography could be done in any way thinkable, and is often used in modern day, as a cheap method of encryption for those who may not have access to advanced tools.
For instance, writing over an innocent message in urine or fruit juice, which can be illuminated using an ultra-violet light. This is commonly known as “invisible ink”.
