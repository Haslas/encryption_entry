So how do you counter this? One big problem with almost all alphabets is that some letters will appear more frequently then others.
So, if you have a reasonably large chunk of text, we can calculate which characters appear more often than others.
We know that the order of frequency in the English language is e t a o I n s h r d l c u m w f g y p b v k j x q z.
Therefore, if a letter in the ciphertext is used significantly more than the rest, it is reasonable to assume this is an E or T.
If there is one that is hardly used at all, it is fair to assume that this is a J, X, Q or Z.
With a large enough ciphertext, we can calculate the frequency of each letter in the ciphertext and compare it to the frequency in normal language.
We can then try subbing in some letters, and trying to fill in the blanks from our human intelligence. For instance, guessing that the word aa__a__ will be aardvark.
This is known as Frequency Analysis, and is one of many techniques to crack this sort of message.
