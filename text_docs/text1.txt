Correct! Atbash was a useful cipher, but it uses the same process to encrypt a “plaintext” message every time the cipher is used.
If everyone encrypts messages using the same process, everyone will decrypt messages using the same process. This means the decrypted information was available to anyone with a basic knowledge of the cipher.
As the cipher spread, it soon became popular and therefore useless.
But, this problem was soon fixed using the scytale. The scytale was a device used by ancient Greeks in around 475BC for secure communication. A scytale is a pole of a fixed diameter. 
The sender would wind a thin piece of fabric around the pole multiple times, forming a surface to write one. Once un-wound it would be difficult to read unless the recipient had an identical scytale.
