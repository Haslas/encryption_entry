The decryption of the enigma machine was a long, complex, and genius solution. I believe it is too advanced for me to explain well and concisely, but I will mention the aftermath.
A collection of mathematicians, classacists, english professors and puzzle enthusiasts worked tirelessly at Bletchley Park during the second world war.
While it was the composite contribution of many men and women across Europe that led to the ultimate destruction of the enigma cipher, it was Alan Turing who made the final breakthrough, and saved many lives in doing so.
After the war, the encryption methods discovered at Bletchley Park were strictly confidential, meaning the heroes working there were sworn to secrecy.
As a result, many people including Turing were labelled as cowards for not fighting in the war, because no one knew their true contribution. Later, Turing was also outed as homosexual, and put to trial.
He was found guilty and was allowed to choose between hormone therapy and prison. Choosing hormone therapy, he soon became over-weight and depressed. He eventually ended his life by eating an apple dipped in cyanide.
It was years after his death that his true contribution was made public knowledge, and he is now rightfully known as a hero.
